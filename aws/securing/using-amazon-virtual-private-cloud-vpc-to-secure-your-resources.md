# Using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to secure your resources

1. Use network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to your VPC.
2. Use security groups to control which instances in your VPC can communicate with each other.
3. Use network interface level security to control which instances can access certain ports and protocols.
4. Use Amazon’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against malicious traffic.
5. Encrypt data in transit and at rest with Amazon’s Key Management Service (KMS).
6. Use identity and access management (IAM) to control user and service accounts access to your VPC resources.
7. Monitor network traffic and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
