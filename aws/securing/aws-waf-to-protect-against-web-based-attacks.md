# AWS WAF to protect against web-based attacks

Set up a web application firewall (WAF), which is a service that monitors, filters, and blocks malicious web traffic.

1. Configure rules to identify common attack patterns, like injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and SQL injection attacks.
2. Use AWS WAF to inspect web requests and block malicious requests based on your configured rules.
3. Monitor web traffic and set up alerts for any suspicious activity.
4. Keep rules and security policies up to date to ensure your application is always protected.
