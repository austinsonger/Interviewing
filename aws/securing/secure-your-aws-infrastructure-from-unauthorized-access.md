# Secure your AWS infrastructure from unauthorized access

1. Create a security-focused AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy: Create an IAM policy that establishes permissions for users and group access, including the ability to view, create, and modify resources. Ensure that the policy is regularly reviewed and updated as needed to maintain security.
2. Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to ensure that only authorized users can access AWS services and resources.
3. Apply Security Groups: Apply security groups to restrict access to specific resources and ports within AWS.
4. Encrypt Data in Transit and At Rest: Use encryption to secure data at rest and in transit, including using SSL/TLS and encryption keys.
5. Monitor Security Logs: Regularly review security logs to ensure that any suspicious or unauthorized activity is identified and addressed in a timely manner.
6. Implement Network Access Controls: Utilize network access controls to limit access to specific IP addresses and regions.
7. Use AWS Organizations: Use AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts and enforce security policies across all accounts.
8. Set Up a Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan: Create a backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure that data is protected in the event of a disruption or data loss.
9. Use AWS Inspector: Utilize AWS Inspector to identify potential security vulnerabilities and other weaknesses in your environment.
10. Update AWS Resources Regularly: Ensure that all AWS resources are regularly updated to the latest versions to maintain security.
