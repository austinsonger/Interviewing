# Protect against security breaches on AWS?

<summary>Implement multi-factor authentication</summary>

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires two or more authentication factors to verify the identity of a user. This can include a combination of something the user knows (e.g. a password), something the user has (e.g. a physical token or key fob) and something the user is (e.g. biometric data).

<summary>Use Amazon Inspector for security scanning</summary>

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps identify security vulnerabilities in your applications. It provides assessments of network accessibility, operating systems, and applications to detect security issues in your AWS environment.

<summary>Enable security logging and monitoring</summary>

Logging and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents. AWS provides services such as CloudTrail and CloudWatch that can be used to monitor and log all API calls made in your AWS environment.

<summary>Use identity and access management (IAM)</summary>

IAM enables you to create and manage users, groups, and roles to control access to AWS resources. IAM also provides granular control over which actions users can perform, as well as the ability to set up temporary access for external users.

<summary>Implement network security</summary>

Network security can be improved by implementing security groups, network access control lists, and virtual private clouds. These tools can be used to limit access to resources and restrict access from specific IP addresses or ranges.
