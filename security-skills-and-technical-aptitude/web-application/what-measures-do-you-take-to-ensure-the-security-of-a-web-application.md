# What measures do you take to ensure the security of a web application?

1. Implement authentication and authorization protocols: Use authentication and authorization protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect to ensure that only authorized users can access the web application.
2. Use secure passwords: Enforce strong passwords for all accounts and require periodic password changes.
3. Regularly update software: Ensure that the web application is regularly updated with the latest security patches and software.
4. Use encryption: Encrypt data and communications with SSL/TLS to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
5. Monitor activity: Use monitoring tools to detect and investigate anomalies in web application activity.
6. Implement input validation: Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and other malicious attacks.
7. Enable firewall protection: Use a web application firewall to protect against malicious requests and traffic.
