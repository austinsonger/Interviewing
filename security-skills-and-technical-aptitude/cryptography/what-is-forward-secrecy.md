# What is Forward Secrecy?

Forward Secrecy is a security feature that ensures that the encryption key used to secure communications between two parties is not stored and can never be used to decrypt any of the previously encrypted data. This means that if an encryption key is compromised in the future, any data that was previously secured by it will remain safe.
