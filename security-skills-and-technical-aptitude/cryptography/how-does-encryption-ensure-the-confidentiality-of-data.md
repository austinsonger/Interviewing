# How does encryption ensure the confidentiality of data?

Encryption is a process of encoding information so that it can only be read by the intended recipient. It is used to secure data so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. This is done by scrambling the data information using an algorithm and then providing a key to the authorized user which can be used to decode the data. This ensures that only authorized users have access to the data, making it confidential.
