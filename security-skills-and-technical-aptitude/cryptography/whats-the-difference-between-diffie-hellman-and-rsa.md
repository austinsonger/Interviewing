# Whatâ€™s the difference between Diffie-Hellman and RSA?

Diffie-Hellman (DH) is an encryption algorithm used for secure key exchange, whereas RSA is an encryption algorithm used for both encryption and digital signatures. DH is mainly used for authentication, whereas RSA is mainly used for secure data transmission. DH is a public key exchange protocol, while RSA is a public key cryptography algorithm. DH is based on the discrete logarithm problem, while RSA is based on the factorization problem. Lastly, DH is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, while RSA is not.
