# What is a key management system?

A key management system (KMS) is a system for securely managing and controlling access to cryptographic keys. It is responsible for generating, storing, distributing, revoking and retiring keys used for encryption and authentication. It is used to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data, and to prevent unauthorized sharing of keys across different systems.
