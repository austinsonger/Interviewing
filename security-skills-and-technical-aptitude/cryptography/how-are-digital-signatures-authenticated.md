# How are digital signatures authenticated?

Digital signatures are authenticated by comparing the digital signature to the public key of the signer. The public key is used to decrypt the signature and verify that it is authentic. Additionally, digital signatures are often timestamped to ensure that they were created at the time they were claimed to have been created.
