# What are block and stream ciphers?

Block ciphers are algorithms that encrypt data in fixed-length blocks, such as 16-byte or 64-byte blocks. These ciphers use one or more keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. Stream ciphers, on the other hand, encrypt data one bit or one byte at a time. They tend to be faster and more efficient than block ciphers, but they are also more vulnerable to attack.
