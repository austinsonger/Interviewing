# Compute

1. What are the components of AWS Compute?&#x20;
2. AWS Compute consists of EC2, Lambda, ECS, Fargate, and Lightsail.
3. What is the purpose of EC2?&#x20;
4. EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows customers to launch virtual servers, known as instances, in a matter of minutes.
5. What is Lambda?&#x20;
6. Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
7. How does ECS work? ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run, manage, and scale Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
8. What is Fargate? Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows users to run containers without having to manage any underlying infrastructure.
9. What is Lightsail? Lightsail is a managed service that makes it easy to set up and manage virtual private servers on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
10. What is the difference between EC2 and Lambda? EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud and is used to launch virtual servers. Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
11. How does Fargate differ from ECS? Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows users to run containers without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run, manage, and scale Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
12. What is the cost of using AWS Compute? The cost of using AWS Compute varies depending on the service you use. EC2 and Lightsail are priced per hour, while Lambda and Fargate are priced per request.
13. What benefits does AWS Compute provide? AWS Compute provides customers with the ability to quickly and easily launch virtual servers, run code in response to events, manage containers, and set up and manage virtual private servers with minimal effort. All of these services provide cost savings, scalability, and flexibility.
14. What is the difference between EC2 and Lightsail? EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud and is used to launch virtual servers. Lightsail is a managed service that makes it easy to set up and manage virtual private servers on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
15. How do I set up a virtual server on AWS Compute? You can set up a virtual server on AWS Compute by using either EC2 or Lightsail. Both services allow you to quickly and easily launch virtual servers in the cloud.
16. What is the difference between ECS and Fargate? ECS is a container orchestration service that allows customers to run, manage, and scale Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows users to run containers without having to manage any underlying infrastructure.
17. What benefits does ECS offer? ECS provides customers with the ability to quickly and easily manage containers, allowing them to easily scale up or down depending on their needs. It also provides cost savings, security, and flexibility.
18. What programming languages does Lambda support? Lambda supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and .NET Core.
19. How does Lambda work? Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. It is triggered by events from other AWS services, web or mobile applications, or from any application that can send an HTTP request.
20. What are the benefits of using Lightsail? Lightsail provides customers with the ability to quickly and easily set up and manage virtual private servers on AWS. It also provides cost savings, scalability, and flexibility.
21. What types of applications can I run on AWS Compute? You can run any type of application on AWS Compute, including web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise applications.
22. What is the difference between Fargate and Lambda? Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows users to run containers without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
23. How do I set up a container on AWS Compute? You can set up a container on AWS Compute using either ECS or Fargate. Both services allow you to quickly and easily manage containers in the cloud.
24. What is the pricing model for AWS Compute? The pricing model for AWS Compute varies depending on the service you use. EC2 and Lightsail are priced per hour, while Lambda and Fargate are priced per request.
25. What security features does AWS Compute offer? AWS Compute offers a variety of security features, including encryption, authentication, and access control.
26. What are the limits for AWS Compute? The limits for AWS Compute vary depending on the service you use. EC2 and Lightsail have limits on the number of instances you can launch, while Lambda and Fargate have limits on the number of requests you can make.
27. What monitoring tools are available for AWS Compute? AWS Compute offers a variety of monitoring tools, including CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, and AWS CloudTrail.
28. What geographies are supported by AWS Compute? AWS Compute is available in 18 regions and 55 availability zones around the world.
