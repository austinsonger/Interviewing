# How does TLS work?

TLS works by establishing a secure, encrypted connection between two parties. When a client connects to a server, the server authenticates itself using a digital certificate and then creates a secure channel using symmetric encryption algorithms. The client and server then exchange data over the secure channel, which is encrypted and decrypted using the same encryption keys.
