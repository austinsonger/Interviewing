# What are the main components of TLS?

The main components of TLS are the Handshake Protocol, the Record Layer, the Alert Protocol, and the Change Cipher Spec Protocol. The Handshake Protocol is used to establish a secure connection between two parties, the Record Layer is used to encrypt and decrypt data, the Alert Protocol is used to inform the two parties of errors, and the Change Cipher Spec Protocol is used to switch to a different set of encryption keys.
