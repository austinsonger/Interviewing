# What is TLS?

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communications over the internet. It provides authentication, data encryption, and integrity verification to ensure that data remains secure and private while in transit. TLS is the successor to the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol and is widely used to secure web traffic, email, VPN connections, and other data transmissions.
