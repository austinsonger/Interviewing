# What are the key algorithms used in TLS?

TLS uses a variety of algorithms for encryption, authentication, and key exchange. The most commonly used algorithms are AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for authentication, and Diffie-Hellman for key exchange.
