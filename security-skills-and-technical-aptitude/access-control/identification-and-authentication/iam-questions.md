What is the role of access control in an IAM system?

1. Answer: Access control is an important part of an IAM system. It is used to manage and control user access to resources or systems. Access control can be used to grant or deny access, as well as to set permissions or restrictions on access.

What is the purpose of audit logging?

1. Answer: Audit logging is used to track user activity and detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity. It can also be used to audit user compliance with security policies and procedures.

What are the different types of identity management systems?

1. Answer: The different types of identity management systems include directory-based systems, role-based access control (RBAC) systems, attribute-based access control (ABAC) systems, and federated identity management (FIM) systems.

What is the difference between role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)?

1. Answer: Role-based access control (RBAC) is based on a user’s assigned roles or responsibilities, while attribute-based access control (ABAC) is based on a user’s attributes.

What is the purpose of multi-factor authentication?

1. Answer: Multi-factor authentication is a security process that requires multiple methods of authentication (e.g. passwords, one-time codes, biometrics) in order to access a resource or system.

What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

1. Answer: Authorization is the process of granting access to resources or systems based on a user’s identity, while authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity.

What is the purpose of identity federation?

1. Answer: Identity federation is a process that allows an organization to securely access and manage user identities across multiple external systems.

What is the purpose of access control lists (ACLs)?
