# What happens at the network layer?

At the network layer, data is routed between networks. This layer is responsible for addressing packets, routing them between networks, and providing flow control and congestion control. It is also responsible for providing end-to-end reliability through retransmission and error checking. Additionally, the network layer is responsible for providing a logical addressing system and for allowing multiple paths to be used between two end points.
