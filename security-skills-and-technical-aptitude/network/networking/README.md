# Networking

1. What is networking? Answer: Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other electronic devices together to share data and resources.
2. What is a network protocol? Answer: A network protocol is a set of rules that govern communication between computers on a network.
3. What is a LAN? Answer: A LAN (local area network) is a network that spans a relatively small area, such as a single building or campus.
4. What is a WAN? Answer: A WAN (wide area network) is a network that spans a large geographic area, such as multiple cities or countries.
5. What is a router? Answer: A router is a device that forwards data packets between two or more networks.
6. What is a switch? Answer: A switch is a device that connects multiple devices together on a single network.
7. What is a hub? Answer: A hub is a device that connects multiple devices together on a single network.
8. What is a gateway? Answer: A gateway is a device that acts as a bridge between two networks and forwards data packets between them.
9. What is VLAN? Answer: VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a technology that allows you to logically segment a single physical network into multiple virtual networks.
10. What is a bridge? Answer: A bridge is a device that connects two or more networks together, allowing them to communicate with each other.
11. What is IP addressing? Answer: IP addressing is the process of assigning a unique identifier to each device on a network, so that they can be identified and communicated with.
12. What is an IP address? Answer: An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify and communicate with devices on the network.
13. What is a subnet mask? Answer: A subnet mask is a number used to identify a specific network on a larger network. It is used to determine which part of an IP address is the network address and which part is the host address.
14. What is a network topology? Answer: A network topology is the physical and logical layout of a network, including the nodes and the connections between them.
15. What is the difference between a router and a switch? Answer: A router is a device that forwards data packets between two or more networks, while a switch is a device that connects multiple devices together on a single network.
16. What is a firewall? Answer: A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, based on a set of predetermined rules.
17. What is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model? Answer: The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes the functions of a communication system at seven layers.
18. What is a network security policy? Answer: A network security policy is a document that outlines the rules and guidelines for how a network should be managed and used. It is designed to protect the network from threats and unauthorized access.
19. What is a virtual private network (VPN)? Answer: A virtual private network (VPN) is a private network that is created over a public network. It is used to securely connect remote users to the corporate network.
20. What is ARP? Answer: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol used to map IP addresses to physical addresses on a network.
21. What is NAT? Answer: NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method of using a single public IP address to hide the IP addresses of multiple devices on a private network.
22. What is a proxy server? Answer: A proxy server is a computer that acts as a gateway between a local network and the Internet. It is used to provide access to the Internet while protecting the local network from malicious traffic.
23. What is a VPN tunnel? Answer: A VPN tunnel is a secure connection between two points over a public network. It is used to securely connect remote users to the corporate network.
24. What is a DHCP server? Answer: A DHCP server is a computer that provides automatic configuration of IP addresses for computers on a network.
25. What is a DNS server? Answer: A DNS server is a computer that resolves domain names to IP addresses.
26. What is a WAP? Answer: A WAP (Wireless Access Point) is a device that provides wireless network access to devices on a network.
27. What is an access point? Answer: An access point is a device that provides wireless network access to devices on a network.
28. What is a modem? Answer: A modem is a device that converts digital signals from computers into analog signals so that they can be transmitted over telephone lines.
29. What is a bridge mode? Answer: Bridge mode is a mode of operation for a network device that allows it to act as a bridge between two or more networks.
30. What is Quality of Service (QoS)? Answer: Quality of Service (QoS) is a set of techniques used to prioritize network traffic, so that certain types of traffic can be given higher priority than others.
31. What is a Network Interface Card (NIC)? Answer: A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a device that connects a computer to a network.
32. What is a network address translation (NAT)? Answer: Network address translation (NAT) is a method of using a single public IP address to hide the IP addresses of multiple devices on a private network.
33. What is a Domain Name System (DNS)? Answer: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses.
34. What is a virtual LAN (VLAN)? Answer: A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a technology that allows you to logically segment a single physical network into multiple virtual networks.
35. What is a wireless access point (WAP)? Answer: A wireless access point (WAP) is a device that provides wireless network access to devices on a network.
