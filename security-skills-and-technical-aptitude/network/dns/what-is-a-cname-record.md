# What is a CNAME Record?

A CNAME record (or Canonical Name record) is a type of DNS record used to point a domain or subdomain to another domain. It is usually used to point a subdomain to a domain name. CNAME records are used to alias one name to another. For example, a CNAME record can be used to point www.example.com to example.com.
