# What is DNS Resolution?

DNS Resolution is the process by which a Domain Name System (DNS) server translates a domain name into an IP address. This allows computers and other devices to communicate with each other over the Internet. When you type a domain name into your web browser, the DNS server looks up the domain name and translates it into an IP address so that the website can be found.
