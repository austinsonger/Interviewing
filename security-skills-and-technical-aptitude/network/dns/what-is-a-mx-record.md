# What is a MX Record?

A MX record (Mail eXchange record) is a type of DNS record that indicates which mail server should be used for receiving emails sent to a domain. The MX record is created in the DNS zone file of a domain and contains the name of the server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of the domain.
