# What is a ND Record?

A ND record (or Null DNS Record) is a specific type of DNS record used to indicate that a domain name does not exist. It is also known as a “null record” or “null pointer”. It is used as a response when a DNS query is received for a non-existent domain. ND records are also used to block access to particular domains.
