# What is a DNS Record?

A DNS record is an entry in a domain name system (DNS) database that provides information about a particular domain, website, or network device. DNS records are used to map a domain name to an IP address and to control email delivery, among other tasks. Common DNS record types include A records, MX records, CNAME records, and TXT records.
