# Explain DNS Record TTL?

TTL stands for Time To Live and is used in DNS records to set the amount of time that the record is valid or "cached" on a local server. A TTL is set in seconds and is used to ensure that any changes made to a record will be quickly propagated around the Internet. The lower the value of the TTL the faster changes to the record will be seen; however, this can lead to a large amount of traffic for the DNS server.
