# What is PTR Record?

PTR (Pointer) records are resource records in the Domain Name System (DNS) used to provide a domain name that corresponds to an IP address. PTR records are also called Reverse DNS records because they allow a DNS server to look up an IP address and return the corresponding domain name. They are used mainly for email servers to ensure that email is sent from a legitimate source.
