**PROBLEM**: Lack of Customer Security Process

So when I came on board there was no defined Customer Security process in place besides communicating back and forth through asana tasks and email. Security team had to manually field endless requests through email for security and compliance documents from both customers and the sales team.&#x20;

With a security team supporting more than a 30 sales & customer success reps, the volume of conversations and back-and-forth was substantial. The security team had to contend with long, repetitive security questionnaires which took hours to complete. On average, the team received 3-5 custom questionnaires per week, often containing questions I've answered many times before.&#x20;

Filling out these questionnaires, while important, diverted the teamâ€™s attention from more pressing security tasks.To start, they were able to drastically reduce the number of custom questionnaires by encouraging retailers to download the standardized CAIQ, VSA, and SIG questionnaires. For the sales team, sharing up-to-date documents such as SOC2 and PCI AOC took just minutes rather than hours or days.&#x20;

Sales teams no longer had to contact the security team to ask for the latest security documents. They could instead point retailers to the Smart Trust Center, knowing that the security team keeps it up to date.

**ACTION**:

* Explored, Selected, and Implemented FormAssembly's 1st customer security portal solution Safebase.&#x20;
