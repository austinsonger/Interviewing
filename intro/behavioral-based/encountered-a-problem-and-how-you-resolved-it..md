# Encountered a problem and how you resolved it.

### Disorganization of Policies

#### S/T (Situation/Task)

\
Each policy was in its own Google Doc in Google Workspace and it was difficult to verify which once policy is the most current, because co-workers would make copies all of the time. And that made it hard when it comes reviewing policies and ensuring that the policies we used for audits were the correct ones.

#### A (Approach)

\
To Resolve this.

* I created a space in Confluence called policy portal



#### R (Results)

\
Ever since we have completed this employees are able to locate the centralize policy portal instead of having to find the URL for the individual policy
