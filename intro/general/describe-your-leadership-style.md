# Describe Your Leadership Style?

I would describe my leadership style as highly democratic. Always trying to empower the people, and make them participate on the decisions we make.

In such a working environment everyone learns from everyone, and the entire department grows.

I find myself having a hybrid method of leadership, both passive and active. Helping to inform our team and align their motivations to produce ideal outcomes.&#x20;

This is how Iâ€™ve found myself leading in the past and doing so with good results.





My leadership style is based on collaboration and trust. I believe in creating an environment of mutual respect and open communication. I strive to empower my team to think critically, solve problems, and make decisions on their own. I focus on providing team members with clear direction and expectations, while also allowing for creativity and innovation. I prioritize a culture of transparency and accountability, where feedback and ideas are welcomed and encouraged.
