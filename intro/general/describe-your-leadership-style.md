# Describe Your Leadership Style?

I would describe my leadership style as highly democratic. Always trying to empower the people, and make them participate on the decisions we make.

In such a working environment everyone learns from everyone, and the entire department grows.

I find myself having a hybrid method of leadership, both passive and active. Helping to inform our team and align their motivations to produce ideal outcomes.

This is how Iâ€™ve found myself leading in the past and doing so with good results.
