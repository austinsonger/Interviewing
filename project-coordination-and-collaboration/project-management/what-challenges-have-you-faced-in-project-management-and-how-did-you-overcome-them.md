# What challenges have you faced in project management and how did you overcome them?

Common challenges faced in project management can include inadequate resources, a lack of communication, unrealistic deadlines, and changes in scope. I overcame these challenges by working with the team to develop a plan that addresses these issues, setting realistic goals and deadlines, and motivating the team to stay focused and on track.
