# How do you determine the level of risk associated with a vendor?

1. Review the vendor’s track record: Check the vendor’s past performance and previous customer reviews to get an idea of their reliability and quality of service.
2. Analyze the vendor’s security: Investigate the vendor’s security measures and processes to understand the level of protection they provide for your data.
3. Evaluate their terms and conditions: Carefully read the contract and any other terms and conditions to be sure that you understand the level of risk you’re taking.
4. Assess the impact of a breach: Consider what would happen if the vendor were to suffer a data breach or other security incident and how that would affect your business.
5. Ask questions: Make sure to ask the vendor specific questions about their security measures and risk management practices.
