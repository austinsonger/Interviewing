# How do you monitor and assess a vendor's performance?

1. Establish measurable performance metrics: Take the time to establish performance metrics for your vendor that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-based (SMART). Consider factors such as quality, cost, customer service, reliability and delivery times.
2. Track performance over time: Monitor vendor performance over time, and use statistical process control (SPC) to identify trends and outliers.
3. Conduct periodic surveys: Regularly survey your customers, vendors and other stakeholders to assess their satisfaction with the vendor's performance.
4. Analyze performance reports: Analyze performance reports provided by the vendor to identify areas of improvement.
5. Facilitate open dialogue: Regularly meet with the vendor to review performance reports and hold discussions on how to improve.
6. Reward good performance: Reward good performance with incentives such as discounts or special deals, or recognition such as awards.
