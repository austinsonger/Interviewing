# Review of Security Requirements for Contracts

**Obligations take on one of three forms:**

1. An obligation to a particular information security control framework, such as NIST, ISO 27001 or ISO 27002; SOC; or a regulatory framework, such as HIPAA, PCI, NERC CIP, etc. Obligation to a framework can mean an obligation to hundreds of controls and considerable expense.
2. An obligation to a specific security or privacy control. These obligations get to the point of the matter, which is generally a specific risk the customer is concerned about rather than a whole class of activity. This is more acceptable and manageable. For instance, an obligation to implement a security awareness for employees based on NERC CIP is much less onerous than implementing NERC CIP, particularly when it does not apply to the situation.
3. An obligation to certain performance activities such as reporting when certain events occur including security events, incidents or breaches, outages or other IT events. On the surface these are reasonable requests but raise risk dramatically for a firm that does not have the wherewithal to identify, log, manage and report on those types of events.
