# Data Exfiltration

### What measures do you take to prevent data exfiltration?

1. Monitor Network Traffic: Regularly monitor and analyze network traffic for malicious or suspicious activity.
2. Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Software: Deploy DLP software that provides visibility into sensitive data across the network and can detect attempted data exfiltration.
3. Implement Encryption: Encrypt data that needs to be transferred over the network or stored on removable media to prevent it from being accessed by unauthorized personnel.
4. Limit Access to Sensitive Data: Limit access to sensitive data to only those personnel who need it in order to perform their duties.
5. Develop an Incident Response Plan: Develop an incident response plan to quickly and effectively respond to any data exfiltration attempts.
6. Monitor User Activity: Monitor user activity to detect any suspicious or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
7. Use Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems: Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection systems to detect and block malicious traffic and data exfiltration attempts.
