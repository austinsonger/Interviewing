# How do you ensure data is encrypted when stored and transferred?

1. Use TLS/SSL encryption protocols to secure data in transit.
2. Use a reliable encryption algorithm such as AES, Twofish, or Serpent to encrypt data at rest.
3. Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and other access control mechanisms to protect data.
4. Ensure that encryption keys are kept safe and secure.
5. Use regular security audits to ensure that data is being properly encrypted and secured.
