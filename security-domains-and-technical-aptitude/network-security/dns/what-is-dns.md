# What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. DNS essentially serves as the Internet's phone book, keeping a log of domain names and matching them to corresponding IP addresses. DNS allows users to type in easy to remember domain names instead of a series of numbers to access websites and other Internet services.
