# Why is DNS monitoring important?

DNS monitoring is important because it helps ensure that the domain name system (DNS) is functioning properly. It is essential for website and application availability, as DNS is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses and routing traffic to the correct locations. DNS monitoring can help identify issues with DNS resolution, such as downtime, slow response times, and incorrect information in DNS records. This helps to identify any potential issues before they become a major problem and helps maintain the reliability of the domain name system.
