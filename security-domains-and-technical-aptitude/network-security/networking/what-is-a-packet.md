# What is a packet?

A packet is a unit of data sent over a network. It is the basic unit of information exchanged between two nodes in a network and contains the address of the sender and the receiver, as well as the data being sent. Packets are typically created by breaking down a larger message into smaller pieces that can be sent over the network and reassembled at their destination.
