# What is the difference between the 'network' layer and the 'Internet' layer?

In the TCP/IP model, there is no "network" layer. The OSI model network layer roughly corresponds to the TCP/IP model Internet layer. In the OSI model the network layer is layer 3; in the TCP/IP model the Internet layer is layer 2.
