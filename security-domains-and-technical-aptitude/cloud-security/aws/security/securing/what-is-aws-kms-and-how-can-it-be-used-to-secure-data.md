# What is AWS KMS and how can it be used to secure data?

AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is an encryption service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps organizations manage encryption keys used to encrypt and decrypt data in the cloud. AWS KMS can be used to store, manage, and control access to encryption keys in a secure, centralised environment. It can also be used to encrypt data stored in various AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon Redshift. Additionally, AWS KMS can be used to enforce access control to encryption keys and to protect data in transit and at rest.
