# How can you secure access to S3 buckets?

1. Enable access logging to track user activity on the buckets.
2. Configure bucket policies to restrict access to specific users, IP addresses, and regions.
3. Use an IAM user for each user with least privilege access.
4. Set up multi-factor authentication for the S3 buckets.
5. Encrypt data at rest by using server-side encryption.
6. Use versioning to protect data from being overwritten or deleted.
7. Set up Amazon S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control access to objects.
8. Monitor Amazon CloudTrail for API activity.
