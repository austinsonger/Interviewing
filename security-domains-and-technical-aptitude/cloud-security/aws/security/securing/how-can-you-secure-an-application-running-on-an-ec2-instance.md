# Secure an application running on an EC2 instance

1. Ensure that the EC2 instance is running the latest version of its underlying operating system, and apply all security patches and updates.
2. Configure the instance to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
3. Configure the firewall and security group settings in the Amazon EC2 console to restrict access to the instance from specific IP addresses and ports.
4. Utilize the Amazon CloudWatch service to monitor the application for any suspicious activity or unusual resource usage.
5. Utilize encryption for any data or credentials stored on the instance.
6. Utilize Amazonâ€™s Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to control access to the instance and its resources.
7. Monitor log files for any suspicious activity.
