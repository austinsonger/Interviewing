# Ensure the security of its data centers?

AWS ensures the security of its data centers by leveraging a variety of controls, including physical security, infrastructure security, identity and access management, encryption and key management, and vulnerability management.&#x20;

Physical security measures include on-site guards, secure access, video surveillance, and visitor management. Infrastructure security measures include firewalls, network segmentation, data encryption, and secure cloud storage.&#x20;

Identity and access management processes ensure that only authorized personnel have access to AWS systems and resources.&#x20;

Encryption and key management ensure that data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Finally, vulnerability management processes scan for, detect, and remediate security vulnerabilities.
