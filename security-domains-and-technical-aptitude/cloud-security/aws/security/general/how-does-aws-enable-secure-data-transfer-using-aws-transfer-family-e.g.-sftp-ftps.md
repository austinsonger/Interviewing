# How does AWS enable secure data transfer using AWS Transfer Family (e.g. SFTP, FTPS)?

AWS Transfer Family enables secure data transfer by providing several methods for data transfer. These methods include Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit and Amazon S3 bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to protect data at rest. Additionally, AWS Transfer Family provides encryption key management to ensure that customer data remains secure. Furthermore, AWS Transfer Family supports a variety of protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, and HTTPS to ensure that customer data is transferred securely and reliably.
