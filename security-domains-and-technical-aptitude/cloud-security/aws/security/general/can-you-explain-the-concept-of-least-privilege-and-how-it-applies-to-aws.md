# Concept of least privilege and how it applies to AWS?

Least privilege is a security principle that limits access rights to a user or application only to the resources that are necessary for the user or application to perform its intended function.

This means that users and applications should be given the minimum access privilege necessary to complete a task.

In AWS, least privilege is applied by assigning IAM roles and permissions to users or applications. These roles and permissions are configured to provide users and applications with only the level of access needed to perform their intended tasks.&#x20;

This helps to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of AWS resources. By granting users only the access they need, AWS helps to protect the customerâ€™s data and applications from potential threats.
