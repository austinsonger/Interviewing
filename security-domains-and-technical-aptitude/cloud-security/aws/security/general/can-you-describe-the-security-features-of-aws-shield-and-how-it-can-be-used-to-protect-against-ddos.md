# Can you describe the security features of AWS Shield and how it can be used to protect against DDoS

AWS Shield is a managed service that provides protection against common DDoS attacks such as SYN floods, UDP floods, ICMP floods, and application-layer attacks. It provides protection for applications running on AWS, including Amazon EC2, Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront, and Elastic Load Balancing.

AWS Shield includes two tiers of protection: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Standard is a free service that provides basic protection against common DDoS attacks. It includes monitoring for DDoS threats and automatic mitigation when necessary. It also includes access to DDoS response experts who can provide additional assistance.

AWS Shield Advanced is a paid service that provides additional protection against large-scale DDoS attacks. It includes access to a dedicated DDoS response team, 24/7 technical support, and access to AWS WAF, a web application firewall that can be used to protect against application-layer attacks.

AWS Shield is designed to protect against both known and unknown threats, and can be used to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks before they can cause application disruptions or outages.
