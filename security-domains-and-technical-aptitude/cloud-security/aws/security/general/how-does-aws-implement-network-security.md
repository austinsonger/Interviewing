# How does AWS implement network security?

AWS implements network security with its Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) feature. VPCs allow the user to create isolated networks, where they can control the virtual networking environment, including the selection of IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.&#x20;

AWS also offers a number of security features such as Security Groups, Network Access Control Lists (ACLs), CloudWatch monitoring, and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF). Additionally, AWS provides encryption for data at rest and in transit, and also provides built-in DDoS mitigation services.
