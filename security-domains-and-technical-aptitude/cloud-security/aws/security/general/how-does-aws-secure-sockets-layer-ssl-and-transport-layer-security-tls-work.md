# How does AWS Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) work?

AWS Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to establish an encrypted connection between two computers over the internet. When the connection is established, the data sent between the two computers is encrypted for privacy, integrity, and authentication. When a secure connection is established, the protocol is negotiated between the two computers to determine which version of the protocol to use and the encryption algorithms to be used. Once the protocol is agreed upon, the connection is established using a handshake process. During the handshake, each computer sends a digital certificate to the other computer to authenticate the identity of the other computer. After the handshake is complete, the encryption keys are exchanged and the secure connection is established. The data is then encrypted using the agreed-upon encryption algorithms and sent over the secure connection.
