# Can you describe the different components of AWS security?

1. Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM controls user access to AWS services and resources by allowing you to create and manage policies for specific users or groups.
2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A VPC is a private network that allows you to control traffic flows between AWS resources and the Internet or your data center.
3. Security Groups: Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your AWS instances and allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic.
4. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs): NACLs act as a second layer of defense to control inbound and outbound traffic for subnets in your VPC.
5. Encryption: AWS provides different encryption options for data at rest and in transit using server-side encryption, client-side encryption, and key management options.
6. Compliance and Governance: AWS provides various compliance and governance frameworks such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and ISO to ensure that the appropriate security and privacy controls are in place.
7. Threat Detection and Monitoring: AWS offers various tools and services for threat detection and monitoring, such as Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, and Amazon Inspector to identify potential threats and remediate them.
