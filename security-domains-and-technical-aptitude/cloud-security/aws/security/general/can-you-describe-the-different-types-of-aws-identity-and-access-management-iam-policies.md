<summary>Resource-based Policies</summary>

Resource-based policies are attached to an AWS resource, such as an Amazon S3 bucket, and grant permissions to an AWS identity (user, group, or role) to access that resource.

<summary>Permissions Boundaries</summary>

Permissions boundaries are an advanced feature of IAM that allow an administrator to set the maximum permissions that an IAM identity (user, group, or role) can have.

<summary>Organization-level Policies</summary>
