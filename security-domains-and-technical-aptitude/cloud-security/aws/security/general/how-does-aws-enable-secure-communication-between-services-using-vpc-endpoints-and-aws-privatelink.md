# Enable secure communication between services using VPC endpoints and AWS PrivateLink?

AWS enables secure communication between services using VPC endpoints and AWS PrivateLink by providing private, secure connections between services inside a VPC. With VPC endpoints, traffic between services stays within the Amazon network and never traverses the internet.&#x20;

With AWS PrivateLink, services are isolated from the public internet and can only be accessed from within the VPC. This helps ensure that all communication is secure and private.
