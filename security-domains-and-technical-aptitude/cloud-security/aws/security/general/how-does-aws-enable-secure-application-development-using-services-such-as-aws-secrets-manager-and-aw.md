# How does AWS enable secure application development using services such as AWS Secrets Manager and AW

AWS enables secure application development using services such as AWS Secrets Manager and AWS IAM by providing the ability to store, retrieve, and rotate application secrets such as passwords, database credentials, and API keys. AWS Secrets Manager helps protect sensitive data by enabling secure, automated, and auditable retrieval of application secrets. AWS IAM provides identity and access management capabilities that enable developers to securely manage access to AWS services and resources. IAM also enables developers to define and enforce authentication and authorization policies that control who can access what resources and when. Together, AWS Secrets Manager and AWS IAM provide a comprehensive set of tools to help developers create and maintain secure applications.
