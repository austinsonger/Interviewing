# Do you have procedures in place to report data breaches in light of GDPR?

The procedures include notifying the data protection authority (DPO) of any data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, and providing the DPO with detailed information about the breach. We also have procedures for notifying affected individuals as soon as possible and providing appropriate remedies and support. Lastly, we have a system in place to investigate and analyze the root cause of the breach, and work to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
