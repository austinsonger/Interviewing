# What are the different types of cryptographic algorithms?

1. Symmetric Key Algorithms: These algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm.
2. Asymmetric Key Algorithms: These algorithms use two different keys for encryption and decryption, such as Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
3. Hash Functions: These algorithms generate a fixed-length output from a variable-length input, such as Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) and Message Digest 5 (MD5).
4. Digital Signature Algorithms: These algorithms are used to verify the authenticity of a message, such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
5. Key Agreement Algorithms: These algorithms are used to exchange cryptographic keys between two or more parties, such as the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE).
