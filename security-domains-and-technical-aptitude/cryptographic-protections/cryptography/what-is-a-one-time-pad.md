# What is a one-time pad?

A one-time pad (OTP) is a type of encryption, in which a secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message or a file. The key is generated using a random source, such as a random number generator, and is only used once. This type of encryption is considered unbreakable, as the key is never reused and the key is completely random.
