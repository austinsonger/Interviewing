# What is a digital certificate?

A digital certificate is a form of electronic identification that is used to prove the identity of an individual, company, or website. It contains information about the identity of the certificate owner such as name, address, public key, and other information that can be used to prove the identity of the owner. It is issued by a trusted third-party known as a Certificate Authority and contains an encrypted public key that can be used to digitally sign documents.
