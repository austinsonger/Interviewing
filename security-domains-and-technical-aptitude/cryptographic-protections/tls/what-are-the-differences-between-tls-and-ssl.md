# What are the differences between TLS and SSL?

TLS and SSL are both security protocols used to encrypt data communications over the internet, but there are some key differences. TLS is the newer and more secure protocol, while SSL is an older protocol that is considered less secure due to its lack of forward secrecy. TLS also supports more encryption algorithms than SSL.
