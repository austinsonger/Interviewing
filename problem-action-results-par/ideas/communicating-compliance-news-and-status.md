* Any processes that we changed or any new processes that was created
* Any documenting what security controls that are passing

* And if any gaps have been found or detected.
* And any upcoming internal audits like User Access Review or sampling of background checks of employees.
* And any new vulnerabilities found via our bug bounty program or application security engineer
* Any vulnerabilities that have been remedidated.
