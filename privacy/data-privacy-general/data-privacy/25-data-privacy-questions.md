# 25 Data Privacy Questions

## What is the purpose of data privacy laws?

> Data privacy laws are designed to protect people's personal information from being misused or improperly accessed. They set out rules and regulations for how companies and organizations must handle, store, and process data about individuals. They also provide rights to individuals regarding their data, such as the right to access, delete, or rectify their data. Additionally, data privacy laws can provide individuals with remedies when their data has been misused.



## How does data privacy protect individuals and organizations?

> Data privacy helps protect individuals and organizations by ensuring that their personal data is collected, stored, and used responsibly. It restricts how personal data can be used and shared, and provides individuals and organizations with control over their data.

By protecting data privacy, companies can protect the security of their systems and the privacy of their customers. Additionally, it helps to prevent identity theft and other malicious activities.



## What is the difference between data privacy and data security?

> Data privacy involves the protection of personal information and data. It is concerned with the use of data by organizations, governments, or individuals, and with the obligations of those who process that data. Data security is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, destruction, or modification. It is focused on protecting the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of data.

## What is the difference between data subject rights and data subject access requests?

> Data subject rights are the various rights granted to individuals under data protection legislation, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of personal data. Data subject access requests (DSARs) are requests made by individuals to access the personal data that is held about them. DSARs are a specific type of data subject right, allowing individuals to exercise their right to access their data.



## What is the role of data minimization in data privacy compliance?

> Data minimization is a key principle of data privacy compliance. It is a practice of only collecting, storing, and using the personal data that is necessary to fulfill a specific purpose. This practice helps to protect individuals by ensuring that only the minimum amount of personal data is used and that it is not used for any other purpose. Data minimization also helps to ensure that organizations are compliant with data privacy laws and regulations.



## What is the purpose of data protection by design and default?
